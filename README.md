# JsonParser
<p> Welcome to JsonParser! A json parsing library made with love and necessity.</p>
<p> It allows you to send data and retrieve data with models.</p>
<p> You just need to state which class you want to transform into a Json file and this project will help you with that. </p>
<p> It uses reflection to create a map of the fields and classes that are kept in the main class and creates a map tree </p>
<p> After this point you can have you jsons transformed into objects as you wanted before and objects transformed into json files. </p>
<p> So far I implemented Swift objects, custom classes and class arrays </p>

## What to expect
This is new and it was written as a need for simple lightweight and modifiable Json parser so there can be bugs and I assume there are some bugs. It uses native libraries so it has no dependencies.


##What should I do if there is a bug?
Write to me so I can fix it :). I want to help as much as I can and if there people who like to try new stuff then it is my duty to help them.

## What to do in the future
* Creating a sample project
